The first step was to import the dependencies needed to transform your data-set. 
Next I read the irst csv and displayed it in a dataframe to further work on it.
The first step of cleaning the data was to check for null values and get rid of them. 
Then I checked the datatype of each column.
I then renamed the columns to make it understandable.
Next came importing and reading another csv file.
This dataset had more columns than could be displayed in the dataframe.
    I needed to display all 53 columns so I decided to put them in a list.
    Next I was able to see all columns that were  in the csv and remove all irrelevant columns.
I then renamedthe columns for this dataset.
    Next I decided to change the datatype of certain columns that made more sense.
        Next I striped any special characters from the dataset.
I did a grouby and summed my first dataframe then joined the two tables by Player Name.
Here I checked for null values and removed all.
The data is not clean and able to be added to any database.
Finally I exported the cleaned dataset to a csv.
